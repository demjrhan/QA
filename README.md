This branch documents my manual QA practice using the OrangeHRM demo application. The goal is to simulate a real-world QA workflow, including test case design, execution, and defect reporting.

---

## Scope

- **Application Under Test**: [OrangeHRM Demo](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/)
- **Test Modules**: Login, Dashboard, PIM (Add Employee), Search, UX/Error handling
- **Test Focus**: Input validation, navigation, UI behavior, bug discovery

---

## Tools

- **Jira** – Test case management and bug tracking  
- **Obsidian** – Personal documentation of test cases, notes, and retrospectives  

---

## Workflow

1. Design test cases in Jira  
2. Execute tests and log results  
3. Report defects in Jira with full details  
4. Write `.md` documentation for each test case in Obsidian  
5. Push documentation here for version control

---

## Deliverables

- Test cases and bugs → Jira (OrangeHRM QA project)  
- Markdown documentation → `/test-cases/` folder  
- End-of-cycle summaries → `test-cycle-summary.md`

---

This repository reflects the documentation side of the QA process and supports learning through structured practice.
