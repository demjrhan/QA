There is two different techniques known about testing. Manual and Automatic testing.

#### Manual Testing
This type of testing is done by person, it involves the user clicking through the app and testing APIs, if they are acting as they supposed to and everything goes in order. This approach is expensive since the user needs to set environment and execute the test by themselves. Addition to this it is important to mention that tester might make typos or omit some steps in the script.

#### Automatic Testing
On the other hand these tests are performed by the machine that executes a test script that was written in advance. This approach is more reliable than the manual testing since the written script steps are not going to be omitted by the machine.
