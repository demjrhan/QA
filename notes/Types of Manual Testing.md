#### Acceptance, Smoke and Integration tests are also can be done manual, but generally it is done automatically.

### White Box Testing

White Box Testing requires the tester to have a solid understanding of the application being tested. This includes knowledge of the **code**, **structure**, and **design** of the product. The tester uses this insight to design and execute test cases that validate logic, control flow, and data flow.

### Black Box Testing

In this method, the tester does not know anything about what is going on under the hood. The only thing considered is what the output was for the given input. By “under the hood,” we mean the structure, design, or implementation of the product being tested. We can also consider this method as a user using the product.
### Gray Box Testing

In this method we are combining black and white box testing into one. The tester is provided with limited knowledge of the structure of the application, this helps them to design test cases more effectively. With this hybrid approach it is aimed to test little bit that little bit this. In general this approach is useful in the website testing.

### Exploratory Testing

In this approach  testers simultaneously learn about the application, design test cases, and execute them. It’s less about following predefined scripts and more about creatively and dynamically exploring the software to find defects.
